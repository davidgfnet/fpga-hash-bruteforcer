Firmware shipped here has a max frequency of 150MHz aproximately.

Flash:

xc3sprog -c cm1 -p 0 -Ixc6lx150.bit cm1_toplevel.bit

You have to also flash the other 3 FPGAs by using -p 1,
-p 2 and -p 3. You may use -s if you have many CM1 boards
attached (so you can specify which board to flash).

You can also use Xilinx's software of course.

If you are using the USB flashing method you should turn stuff
ON and then put the controller in JTAG mode:

./cm1_mgr 0 poweron
./cm1_mgr 0 jtag enable

Beware that the the manager doesn't support serial numbers right now.
